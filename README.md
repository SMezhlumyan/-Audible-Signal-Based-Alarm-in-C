**Audible Signal-Based Alarm in C**

---

**Objective**

Develop a program in C that sets an alarm for a user-defined number of seconds and plays an audible alert when the alarm expires.

---

**Description**

This program utilizes the `alarm()` function and signal handling in C to create an audible alert. It prompts the user to input the number of seconds for the alarm, sets the alarm using `alarm()`, and handles the `SIGALRM` signal to trigger an audible alert.

---

**Requirements**

**User Input:**
- Prompt the user to enter the number of seconds to set the alarm.

**Setting the Alarm:**
- Use the `alarm()` function to schedule an alarm for the specified number of seconds.

**Handling SIGALRM:**
- Implement a signal handler for `SIGALRM` to trigger an audio playback or generate a beep sound.

**Generating Sound:**
- Use system commands or library functions to play a sound.
- For a simple beep sound, use `printf("\a")`.
- For playing an audio file, use a command like `system("aplay /path/to/sound.wav")` to play a WAV file using the `aplay` utility.

**Suggested Implementation**

1. Use `printf` to prompt the user to enter the number of seconds for the alarm.
2. Set the alarm using `alarm()` with the user-defined number of seconds.
3. Implement a signal handler function for `SIGALRM` using `signal()` or `sigaction()`.
4. In the signal handler function, use `printf("\a")` for a simple beep sound or `system("aplay /path/to/sound.wav")` to play an audio file.
5. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc -o alarm alarm.c`).
6. Run the executable (`./alarm`) to set off the alarm.
